# 🐣 HatchStride

A step-powered virtual pet app built with:

- 🧠 TypeScript
- ⚙️ Node.js + Express + MongoDB
- 🎨 Vue 3 + Vite frontend

Each pet has a unique personality, backstory, and only one life. Walk to earn supplies, care for your buddy, and see how far you can go.

> Built with love by Lisa Meyer @ as a CockieCoding project @ as a weird and wacky app to learn a new tech stack. 💛

(Ps. Still in progress...)
